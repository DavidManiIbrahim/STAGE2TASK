# Invoice Management App

A fully functional and responsive Invoice Management Application built with React and Vite. This project allows users to create, manage, and track invoices with features like filtering, status management, and a built-in light/dark mode. 

## 🚀 Features and Functionalities

### 1. Invoice Management (CRUD)
- **Create Invoices:** Open an intuitive form to fill out client details, items, and pricing.
- **Read Invoices:** View a comprehensive list of all invoices or click on a specific invoice to view its full details.
- **Update Invoices:** Edit existing invoices and persist updated values.
- **Delete Invoices:** Remove invoices with a confirmation modal to prevent accidental deletions.

### 2. Form Validations
- Strict form validation ensures data integrity before submission.
- Prevents submission if required fields are empty, email formats are invalid, or if item quantities and prices are not positive numbers.
- Displays clear error messages and visual error states for invalid fields.

### 3. Draft & Payment Flow
- **Three Statuses:** Invoices can be marked as `Draft`, `Pending`, or `Paid`.
- **Save as Draft:** Users can save an incomplete invoice as a Draft to edit later.
- **Mark as Paid:** Pending invoices can be updated to Paid once settled. (Note: Paid invoices cannot be reverted to Draft).
- Statuses are clearly reflected in both the list and detail views with distinct badge colors and styles.

### 4. Filter by Status
- Intuitive checkbox filtering allows users to view invoices by status (`All`, `Draft`, `Pending`, `Paid`).
- The filtered state updates the invoice list immediately.
- Displays a dedicated empty state illustration when no invoices match the selected filter.

### 5. Light & Dark Mode
- Global toggle between light and dark themes.
- Theme preferences are persisted in `LocalStorage`, ensuring the user's choice is remembered across sessions.
- Designed with good color contrast in both modes for optimal readability.

### 6. Fully Responsive Design
- The layout adapts seamlessly across devices:
  - **Mobile:** 320px+
  - **Tablet:** 768px+
  - **Desktop:** 1024px+
- Forms are highly usable on mobile devices with no horizontal overflow.

### 7. Interactive UI & Accessibility
- Visible hover states on all interactive elements (buttons, links, list items, status filters, form inputs).
- Built with semantic HTML and proper accessibility practices.
- Modals trap focus, close via the ESC key, and are keyboard navigable.

### 8. Data Persistence
- Invoice data and application state are persisted using `LocalStorage` (or Context API), ensuring data is not lost upon page reload.
